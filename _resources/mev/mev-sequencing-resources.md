## Background

> [Measles virus sequencing | A guide to sequencing for genomic epidemiology](/mpxv/artic-mpxv-guide)
: This is an overview guide and set of recommendations for MeV genome sequencing with an emphasis on genomic epidemiology. 

## Setup Guides

> [Setting up and using EPI2ME for MeV analysis pipelines](/mpxv/mpxv-epi2me-setup.html) 
: This document walks-through how to install and setup Oxford Nanopore Technology's EPI2ME software package so that it can be used to run ARTIC bioinformatics pipelines on a Desktop or Laptop computer without having to use a command-line interface.

## MeV sequencing
